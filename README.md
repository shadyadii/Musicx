Music Recommendation System

Welcome to the Music Recommendation System repository! This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to create an intelligent music recommendation system.

Features:
K-means Clustering: Grouping songs based on similar features to identify patterns and clusters in the data.

t-SNE Visualization: Visualizing high-dimensional song data in a 2D space to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between songs.

PCA Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis, enabling efficient feature representation.

Personalized Recommendations: Providing personalized music recommendations based on the user's preferred clusters and patterns.

Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests. Let's enhance this music recommendation system together!
